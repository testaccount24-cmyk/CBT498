  Module Name: MTCHMRG                            Date: 03/00
  Title: Match/Merge                              Programmer: C. Schneiderwent
  ****************************************************************************

  1.   The purpose of this program is to provide a convenient method of match
       merging two datasets.

  2.   The program performs the following functions:

       *    Match/merge SYSUT1 and SYSUT2
       *    Matching records are concatenated and output to SYSUT3,
            SYSUT2 records are concatenated to the end of the matching
            SYSUT1 records
       *    Unmatched SYSUT1 records are output to SYSUT4
       *    Unmatched SYSUT2 records are output to SYSUT5
       *    Matched SYSUT1 records are output to SYSUT6
       *    Matched SYSUT2 records are output to SYSUT7
       *    At least one of SYSUT3, SYSUT4, SYSUT5, SYSUT6, SYSUT7 must be
            specified in the execution JCL

       Program processing is determined by parameters or a control card.
       The format of the parameters is

       PARM='000120002300042'
             LLLLL1111122222

       LLLLL = Length of key
       11111 = Offset of key in SYSUT1
       22222 = Offset of key in SYSUT2

       The control card parameter is identical and is specified on
       SYSIN.  If the parm is present it overrides the presence of SYSIN.
       If the parm is absent, SYSIN must be specified.

       Return Codes:

       0 - normal EOJ
       1 - multiple records with the same key found in both input files
       8 - error, see SYSPRINT

       When multiple records with the same key are found in both input
       files, each such record from SYSUT1 is matched with each such
       record from SYSUT2.

       Informational messages are written to SYSPRINT.

  Sample execution JCL

  //             LRECL=same as SYSUT1 LRECL,
  //             RECFM=FB,
  //             SPACE=(same as LRECL,(1000,100)),
  //             UNIT=WORK

  //             LRECL=same as SYSUT2 LRECL,
  //             RECFM=FB,
  //             SPACE=(same as LRECL,(1000,100)),
  //             UNIT=WORK
  //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*

  Note that SYSUT3, SYSUT4, SYSUT5, SYSUT6 and SYSUT7 need not all be
  specified.  If the desired function is to detect only unmatched
  records from SYSUT2, only SYSUT5 need be specified.

  4.   Source Language:  Assembler

  5.   Limitations:

       *    This program will only process sequential datasets
       *    This program will only process fixed length records
       *    The key comparison is a CLC instruction (CLCL when the
            key length exceeds 256) so it is inadvisable to use
            packed data as a key unless you are certain the sign
            nibbles are consistent
       *    Since SYSUT3 consists of concatenated records from
            the two input files, there is an inherent length
            limitation: the sum of the two input LRECLs must
            be <= the maximum LRECL possible
       *    Both input files must be sorted by the match merge key
